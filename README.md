Parametric form - November 3, 2014

This is my HW4 on Parametric form; there are three different potentiometer knobs, depending on height, diameter,
and the height of the inner shaft diameter. Furthermore, you can designate if you want an indicator notch.

All of the renders chose to have the indicator notch, but you can choose to omit it if you wish.

I worked alone on this, as it was homework.
